My first try at [Node](nodejs.org). Be nice. It's a simple lookup script which launches a couple default browser instances locally based on the command-line -b &lt;input&gt; value. I did it to simplify a job search, but you can use it for any sort of lookups you might want to do.

## usage:
`$> npm install minimist openurl`
`$> node quicklookup.js -b <company_name>`
